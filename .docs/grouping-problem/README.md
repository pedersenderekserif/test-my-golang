# Grouping Problem

This is the Grouping Problem, it's one that we have had to solve previously here at Serif Health and mainly looking to get an idea of how you would go about thinking, solving, and implementing a solution to it. The applicant is not required to produce anything at the end of the problem, just to have been able to demonstrate their ability to reason through this type of problem.

We have a customer who publishes a set of txt files, an allowed amounts file and an in network rates file, and they need us to collect all of the relevant pricing files and group them together per plan. 

How would you go about doing this?

What possible cost concerns might we have in grouping these price files? How might they be mitigated?
